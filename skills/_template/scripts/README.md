# Example Script

This directory contains executable scripts that the agent can run when using this skill.

Scripts should be:
- Self-contained with clear error messages
- Include usage/help information
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Return meaningful exit codes (0 = success, non-zero = error)

## Example Structure

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Description of what this script does

set -euo pipefail

# Script implementation here
```
